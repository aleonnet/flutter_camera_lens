# flutter_lens

A Flutter project for tracking camera lens

## Getting Started

This project is an application that I will not publish in appstore. It's fully functions and runable with smooth performance.
Feel free to use it or publish to appstore/ playstore with your account.

## Techical details:
- Bloc pattern.
- Theme data provider(you may implement switch theme function, but it quite easy).
- All screens splitted to small parts to avoid headache while reading infinity widget tree in code :v.
